This GitHub contains my Java backend projects and learning work.

I mainly work on backend services using Java and Spring Boot, focusing on how backend systems are built and connected. Most repositories here are small, focused projects meant to understand one backend concept at a time.

**Tech I use:**
Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, MySQL, Maven, Redis, Kafka, Eureka, Git

**Backend projects:**
**User Service** – user management and authentication APIs
**Product Service** – CRUD APIs with pagination and sorting
**Payment Service (Stripe)** – payment flows, redirects, and webhook handling
**Caching (Redis)** – using cache to reduce database load
**Messaging (Kafka)** – basic producer and consumer implementations
**Service Discovery (Eureka)** – service registry for discovering backend services

**Design and fundamentals:**
**TicTacToe** – Java game implementation focusing on logic and state handling
**Parking Lot (LLD)** - object-oriented low-level design practice
**SOLID / Design Principles** – Java examples of core design concepts

My focus is backend development, writing readable code, and understanding how backend systems work together.
